Sprint Review and Retrospective
Interpreting User Needs and Implementing Them Into a Program
Understanding user needs is crucial in software development, as it ensures that the final product aligns with customer expectations. One effective way to capture these requirements is through user stories. User stories provide a simple, non-technical way to describe features from the end-user's perspective. By breaking down features into user stories, developers can prioritize work, ensure functionality aligns with real-world use cases, and iterate efficiently based on feedback. Implementing user stories into a program allows for incremental development, where features are continuously refined and adjusted according to user feedback.

Approach to Developing Programs and Agile Processes for Future Development
My approach to software development follows an Agile methodology, where development is iterative and adaptive. I focus on breaking down tasks into manageable sprints, ensuring that each increment adds value to the project. Throughout this course, I have applied Scrum principles, such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives, to enhance collaboration and efficiency. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate Test-Driven Development (TDD) to improve code quality, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for faster deployment, and Kanban boards to track progress and optimize workflow.

Being a Good Team Member in Software Development
Collaboration is at the heart of Agile development, and being a good team member means actively communicating, providing constructive feedback, and being adaptable to changing requirements. Throughout this course, I have learned the importance of participating in Scrum events such as sprint reviews and retrospectives to share insights and improve team efficiency. A good team member also respects deadlines, assists teammates when needed, and fosters a culture of continuous improvement. The success of a project depends not only on technical skills but also on how well the team works together to solve problems and meet objectives.
